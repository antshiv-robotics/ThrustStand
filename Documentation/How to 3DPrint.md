# This file will teach you how to 3D Print the parts

## Prerequisites
Access to a 3D printer
Recommended 3D printer: Prusa i3 MK3S
Recommended 3D printer filament: PETG

## 3D Printing
The 3D model files are located in the [3d_models](../Hardware/Mechanical/3d_Model/) folder.
The 3D model files are modelled using Solidworks.
The 3D model files are exported as 3MF files in [3d_print_files](../Hardware/Mechanical/3d_Print/) folder.

## 3D Printing Settings
To print the parts you will need to use the following settings:
* Layer height: 0.2mm
* Infill: 20%
* Print speed: 60mm/s
* Print temperature: 240C
* Bed temperature: 100C
* Support: No
* Raft: No
* Brim: No
* Cooling: No
* Filament diameter: 1.75mm
* Filament type: PETG

## 3D Printing Tips
* Make sure the 3D printer is level
* Make sure the 3D printer is calibrated
* Make sure the 3D printer is clean
* Recommeded to have a 3D printer enclosure
* Make sure the 3D printer is well maintained
* Make sure the 3D printer is well lubricated
* Make sure the 3D printer is well ventilated
* Make sure the 3D printer is well heated before printing
